# Web Intro
Write and publish your first web page with HTML, CSS, and JS


### Setup

1. Create a class folder on your computer called `dig245`
- Put it somewhere that makes sense. 
- **Only use lowercase!** Capitalization matters on computers and the internet. This file `images/Logo.png` is different than this file `images/logo.png`
2. Add a projects folder inside the class folder `dig245/projects/`
3. Fork this repo
4. Now clone the repo to or open it with Github on your own machine
```
git clone <repo_url>
```
5. Save it to your class projects folder



2. Create a file called index.html
3. Add the following to the file
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is my first web page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
4. Save the file and open it in Chrome
5. Make another edit to the file and view the edit again in Chrome.
